# SOLID Principles in Dart and Flutter

This repository is dedicated to the study and implementation of SOLID principles in Dart and Flutter.

## Introduction

SOLID is an acronym that represents five principles that help manage dependencies in your code:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

These principles make it easier to maintain your code, and they make your code more readable, scalable, and testable.
